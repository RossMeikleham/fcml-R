<h2>Sample-based approximations to expectations</h2>
<p>We will try and compute the expected value of $y^2$ where $y\sim U(0,1)$,
i.e.
$$ E_{p(y)}(y^2) $$
Analytically, we can compute the value as:
$$ E_{p(y)}(y^2) = \int_{0}^1 y^2 p(y) ~dy = \int_{0}^1 y^2~dy =
\left[\frac{1}{3}y^3 \right]_0^1 = \frac{1}{3} $$
To compute a sample based approximation, we will draw samples from $U(0,1)$,
square them, and compute the average.
</p>

```{r}
maxN <- 1000
u <- runif(maxN, 0, 1)**2
expected_val <- rbind(rep(0, maxN-1))
for (i in 1:(maxN-1)) {
  expected_val[i] <- mean(u[1:i])
}
```

<p>Plot the evolution of the expectation.</p>

```{r}
plot(0:(maxN-2), expected_val, xlab="Number of samples", col="red",
      ylab="Expected value of y^2", ylim=c(0.25, 0.5), xlim=c(0,1000),
      type="l")
abline(h = 1/3, col="blue")
